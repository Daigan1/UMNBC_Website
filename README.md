## Outline
1. Fork the repo or git pull main branch
2. npm init in the terminal
3. create a .env file in the server folder (dm #project channel on discord and i'll send you api keys)
4. run the backend by going into the server folder and doing npm run dev in the terminal
5. run the front end by going into the src folder and doing run npm start

# Step by Step after you fork the repo
## -> src folder
1. if youre in the UMNBC_Website_Fork directory
    - check by doing pwd in terminal
    - cd .. (this moves you a folder back/out)
    - cd [[folder-name]] (this moves you into the folder)
    - npm start (once you are in the src folder. So ex in terminal: cd src)

## -> server folder
    - npm run dev (once you are in the server folder)

## If you need help with cd and terminal
